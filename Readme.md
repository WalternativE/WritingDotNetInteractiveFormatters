# Writing Dotnet Interactive Formatters

Ever wanted to know how you can extend dotnet interactive with custom formatters? Yes? Good!
In this repo you can find [a notebook](Formatters.ipynb), that takes a look at how some custom
.NET/F# types get formatted and how you can add little extras for your use cases. No in-depth look
but enough to get you started quickly.

If you want to go a bit further and share your formatters (and other extensions) with others
it would make sense to ship them as reusable NuGet packages. This repo contains a project
as well as an [accompanying notebook](ExtensionDevelopment.ipynb), that should point you in the right
direction for this task.
